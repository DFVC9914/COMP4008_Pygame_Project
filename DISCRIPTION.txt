The game is a parkour game, divided into four levels from easy to hard. 
Each level involves avoiding monsters and collecting gems. 
The first three levels are unlocked, and the final level is unlocked when the total score reaches 3000 points. 
Collect 100 gems on each level and the game is cleared by collecting 400 gems in total. 
As the same player plays, his score and the number of gems he has received are displayed at the start of the game!
