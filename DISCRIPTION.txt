The game is a parkour game, divided into four levels from easy to ultimate. 
Each level involves avoiding monsters and collecting gems. 
The first three levels are unlocked, and the ultimate level will be unlocked after achieving the condition (Get 100 red, 100 green and 100 orange gems respectively). 
Warrior's sister will be resurrected after collecting 400 gems in total on each level. 
As the same player plays, the number of gems he got would be displayed at the start_screen!
